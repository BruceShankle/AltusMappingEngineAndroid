The BA3 Altus Mapping Engine(TM) is a high-performance library designed for Android developers who are creating
both simple and demanding mapping apps for Android 4.0 or higher.

Developers using things like MapKit and Route-Me generally run into performance,
capacity or feature walls that block development, and the Altus Mapping Engine can eliminate those walls.
